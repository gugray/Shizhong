TO-DO
=====================================
OK fine-tune by manipulating TCNT0
OK measure temp
OK faces neatly
OK periodic temp measurement
OK whole static correction shebang
   OK apply correction
   OK omit too-short time
   OK store and load from EEPROM
OK critical section around totalSeconds?
OK verify current draw
-- BUG: set time screen times out on seconds
-- design & order board v1
-- measure and eval green & red LED effect and current
-- temperature-based dynamic corrections

To consider:
-- LED light button somewhere?
-- hours elapsed screen in tune face
-- do we need temperature screen? maybe midtemp calibration instead? do both fit?
-- do we need calibration history? its own screen?


Batery capacity ballpark
=====================================
CR2032 conservative capacity: 200mAh
At 50uA:  4000h, or 23 weeks
At 20uA: 10000h, or 59 weeks
At 15uA: 13333h, or 79 weeks ~ 1.5 years 
CR2: 800mAh
At 50uA: 16000h, or 95 weeks

Baseline sleep cycle, with no LCD update: 12.5uA
Spikes to ~40uA for update

Power draw with sleep to IDLE and no LCD refresh, Timer 0 as default: 400uA
Strangely, turning off Timer 0 only brings it down to 396uA
With my Timer0: 600uA

Temperature measurement
At 10 bits, DS18B20 takes 187ms -> 200ms
Active current max 1.5mA
At a 10-minute cadence: .2s out of 600s: 0.0005 mA equivalent: 0.5uA
This is not counting CPU draw during OneWire comms, but that's very quick

Experiment with 4700uF cap + 100k or 10k resistor: 14.3uA
-> this didn't catch temp measurement, so previous estimate of 0.5uA comes on top
